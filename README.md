# To Do List Project

This is a simple project to study the development of web applications with AngularJS.

## Get started

### Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/AlexJCosta/todo-list-fe
cd todo-list-fe
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `3000`.
